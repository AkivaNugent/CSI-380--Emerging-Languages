# CSI-380-CRYSTAL-Presentation

## Basic game Idea:

It would be a small window that shows 3 HP bars on the left (ppg party memebers) and a single healthbar on the right (a boss) 


the boss would attack every X seconds (3 right now) on a cooldown.
- The boss attacks even if you do nothing (fibers and concurrency)

the party memebers also work on seperate cooldowns
- more concurency

you can attack, defend, or heal

When HP of your team hit 0 you lose, the boss hits 0 you win.

This is a really simple program, but also im not sure what else to do to maken it more complicated. I also dont super care about making it really all that complicated. It shows the syntax well enough and uses fibers which is a selling point of Crystal.

## Whats done
- the game

## What still needs to be done
- Refine the jank if we want, but we really dont need to.
